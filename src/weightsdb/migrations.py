"""weightsdb.migrations — a programmatic Alembic wrapper.

One linear history per application, from the first release (database standards §5). This module
never shells out to the ``alembic`` CLI or reads an ``alembic.ini`` — it builds an in-memory
:class:`alembic.config.Config` and drives :mod:`alembic.command` directly, always against the
already-configured :class:`~sqlalchemy.Engine` the caller built with
:func:`~weightsdb.engine.create_engine_for`, so every migration runs with the same pragmas and
transaction semantics as the rest of the application — never a second, differently configured
connection built from the bare URL.

Moved from FreeWeight's ``infrastructure.db.migration`` (ADR-0011), renamed to the plural
``migrations`` to match this package's own module-naming choice; behaviour is unchanged except that
backup and restore now go through :mod:`weightsdb.backup` instead of an application-local module.
