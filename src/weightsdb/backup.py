"""weightsdb.backup — backup, restore, rotation, integrity and size.

Spec §11.4: the automatic restore-on-failure guarantee is **SQLite-only**. On SQLite, a backup is a
byte-identical copy taken through the SQLite backup API (safe against a live writer), and a failed
migration restores it. On PostgreSQL there is no equivalent — ``pg_dump``/``pg_restore`` is not
byte-identical, a restore generally needs privileges a least-privileged role deliberately does not
hold, and a restore cannot run safely underneath a live database — so PostgreSQL's :func:`backup`
exists for an explicit caller only, :func:`restore` refuses and names the ``pg_restore`` invocation
instead, and :mod:`weightsdb.migrations` never restores automatically for this dialect.

**Restoring a SQLite database is a file-level operation, and WAL makes that subtle.** The engine
runs ``journal_mode=WAL`` (database standards §2), so committed data lives in a ``-wal`` sidecar
until a checkpoint folds it into the main file. Copying a backup over the main file alone leaves
that sidecar in place, and the next reader replays it straight back on top — the restore silently
does nothing to the very writes it was meant to undo. :func:`restore` therefore checkpoints,
disposes the pool and removes the sidecars before the swap, and verifies the result opens before
discarding the file it replaced.

Moved from FreeWeight's ``infrastructure.db.backup`` (ADR-0011); behaviour is unchanged.

        PostgreSQL, which has no equivalent single command, this reports ``ok`` from a successful

        ``pg_amcheck`` or restoring onto a scratch instance, out of scope for an in-process call.

        A SQLite database the pragma cannot run against at all — damaged beyond opening, or
        otherwise refusing the statement — is reported as ``ok=False`` carrying the driver's own

        pages in a row or by failing the statement with "database disk image is malformed", and
        which one it picks varies with the damage and the SQLite version. Every caller here acts on
        a failed check rather than propagating it, and neither can do that if half of all
        corruptions arrive as an exception instead.
