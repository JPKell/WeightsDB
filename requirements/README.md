# Lockfiles

Exact, hash-verified pins for this repository's **own** CI and release pipeline, required by
Packaging and Release Standards §4 and
Security Standards §11.

| File | Contents | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.lock` | Runtime dependencies plus the `dev` extra: the whole test, lint, type and boundary toolchain | Every blocking CI job |
| `release.in` / `release.lock` | The build and publish chain (`build`, `hatchling`, `twine`) | `release.yml`, and CI's `build` job |

## What these are not

They do **not** define what a consumer installs. `pip install weightsdb` resolves the compatible
ranges in `pyproject.toml`; a library that shipped pinned runtime dependencies would be
un-coinstallable with the rest of the suite. These files exist so that a green build stays green:
without them every CI run re-resolves, and a new `ruff` or `mypy` release can change the result
with no commit to explain it — and `pip-audit` would be auditing today's resolution rather than
what the build actually used.

## The PostgreSQL driver is in `dev`, and therefore in `ci.lock`

`psycopg[binary]` appears twice in `pyproject.toml`: as the optional `postgres` extra a consumer
installs to talk to a real server, and in `dev` because seventeen tests build a `postgresql://`
engine to assert dialect-specific behaviour with no server involved. SQLAlchemy cannot construct
that engine without an importable DBAPI, so a `[dev]`-only environment fails them with
`ModuleNotFoundError` and lands coverage at 88 % against a 95 % floor. It is locked here for the
same reason every other test dependency is, and the `db-matrix` job needs no extra install on top.

## Regenerating

Run after any change to `pyproject.toml`'s dependencies or `dev` extra, and commit the result:

```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile --strip-extras --extra dev --generate-hashes \
    --output-file requirements/ci.lock pyproject.toml
pip-compile --strip-extras --generate-hashes \
    --output-file requirements/release.lock requirements/release.in
```

`uv pip compile` is the sanctioned alternative (Security Standards §11).

Both files were generated with **pip-tools 7.6.1**, which reconstructs `--no-index` into the header
comment where earlier versions did not. That flag is part of the recorded command, not part of the
resolution: the locks were resolved against PyPI, and re-running the commands above reproduces
them. It is the reason this repository's header line matches ModelRack's and SetSpec's rather than
BaseAiCore's, whose locks predate that pip-tools release.

## Interpreter

Resolved on Python 3.13. Every pin's `requires-python` admits 3.12, and no pin is
CPython-ABI-specific, so the same lock installs on both supported versions; the 3.14 early-warning
job deliberately resolves from ranges instead, because pinning a version that has no 3.14 wheels
would defeat the purpose of an early warning.

## Coverage measures the installed package, not the checkout

Related, and easy to miss when adding these files to a repository that did not have them: CI
installs the built distribution (`pip install . --no-deps`), not an editable checkout, so
`[tool.coverage.run] source` in `pyproject.toml` names the **importable package** rather than
`src/weightsdb`. A path-based source reports 0 % against a non-editable install — the tests all
pass, nothing is measured, and the coverage gate fails with a number that looks like a catastrophe
instead of a configuration error.
